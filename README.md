# Sap2000 Shell Designer
I developed this program for rebar designing of concrete shells modeled in SAP2000. 
This program is able to manipulate SAP2000 for analyzing and reading the output data, as well as making an interactive relation between the program and SAP2000 GUI for getting elements to be designed.
This program is able to design reinforcement and control the crack width according to ACI code.
By this program more than 1000 pages of calculation reports for concrete shells were generated quickly!
